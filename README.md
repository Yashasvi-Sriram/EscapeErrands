## What?
EscapeErrands is a sopisticated yet intuitive task/goal management system

## Why?
* The philosophy behind
    * __See the things you can, clearly! For if you do so, you can see those beyond__
* EscapeErrands enables the user to be stateless in his/her daily life. 
* It pushes the user to organize his/her tasks properly and removes the need to remember them
* The intention however is not to impose user to forget everything, but to provide a means to swap out all the irrelevant information (for the time being) so that the user can focus on the present
* EscapeErrands can organize arbitrarily complex tasks, store and visualize them in an orderly and relevant fashion
* It comes handy when user has quite a number of interdependent tasks
