# Escape Errands
My solution to mundane

# What is it?
A tool to take care of the mundane so that you can really focus on interesting things
* It will make your more organized, but actually decreases your effort in doing so
* It will enable you to be free of mind or stateless
    * The intention however is not for you to forget everything, but to provide a means to swap out all the currently irrelevant information stuff to a safe place
* It can understand arbitrarily complex tasks, store and visualize them beautifully
* It really comes in handy if you have a lot of interdependent tasks dangling over your head

# Zen of Escape Errands
