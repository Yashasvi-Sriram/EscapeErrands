Why?
====
* The philosophy: See the things you can clearly, for if you do so you can see those you could not. 

* The aim is to enable the user to be stateless in daily life i.e. to remove the need to remember and/or make plans in air

* The intention is not to impose user to forget everything, but to provide a means to swap out irrelavant information for a time being to a persistent place which can be restored back when its time comes
