=====
EscapeErrands is a comprehensive and intuitive task/goal management system

Why?
====
* The philosophy: See the things you can clearly, for if you do so you can see those you could not. 

* The aim is to enable the user to be stateless in daily life i.e. to remove the need to make and/or remember plans in air

* The intention however, is not to impose user to forget everything, but to provide a means to swap out irrelavant information (for the time being) to a persistent & secure place which can be restored when its time comes

* This way user can focus on the present stuff, without worrying about forgetting those in future

* This comes handy especially when user has quite a number of interdependent tasks
